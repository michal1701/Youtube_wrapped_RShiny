# Youtube Wrapped RShiny
https://mrozmikolaj.shinyapps.io/Youtube_wrapped/
  
This app was made as a part of the Data Visualization Techniques university course made using YouTube data. The app allows you to analyze and visualize data from YouTube, providing insights into the most popular channels and videos as well as patterns in YouTube viewership.

The app offers several features, including a frame displaying the most-watched channels on YouTube, allowing you to explore which channels are the most popular among users. You can also view the most-watched video and get a sense of what content is most engaging to YouTube viewers.

In addition, the app provides graphs showing the time of day when people watch YouTube the most. This information can be useful for content creators and marketers looking to optimize their video posting schedules and target their audiences effectively.

If you want to try the app yourself, you can use the link from the top of the page.
